# Fedora Mobile

Fedora Mobile is a one-stop-shop application for interacting with the Fedora
community you know and love, on the go.

It provides access to several applications run throughout the Fedora
Infrastructure, and allows contributors and users to stay involved without
being in front of a computer.

Some things that Fedora Mobile sets out to do:

- Provide account synchronization between your phone and the
  [Fedora Accounts System](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/) using the
  Android Accounts Provider API.
- Provide access to [Fedocal](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/calendar/)
- Be able to quickly check the [status](http://status.fedoraproject.org/) of
  Fedora services.
- [Tag packages](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/tagger/)
- [Search packages](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/)
- And more.

We target Android 3.0+ for the time being. The reason for this is that Fedora's
mission is to "lead the **advancement** of free and open source software and
content as a collaborative community" - advancement being key.

Not having to deal with 2.x's quirks also lets us do some things more cleanly
and take advantage of newer features like Navigation Drawers and the Action Bar
without having to depend on thirdparty hacks/libraries.
