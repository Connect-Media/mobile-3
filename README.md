# Fedora Mobile

Fedora Mobile is a one-stop-shop application for interacting with the Fedora
community you know and love, on the go.

It provides access to several applications run throughout the Fedora
Infrastructure, and allows contributors and users to stay involved without
being in front of a computer.

Some things that Fedora Mobile sets out to do:

- Provide account synchronization between your phone and the
  [Fedora Accounts System](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/) using the
  Android Accounts Provider API.
- Provide access to [Fedocal](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/calendar/)
- Be able to quickly check the [status](http://status.fedoraproject.org/) of
  Fedora services.
- [Tag packages](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/tagger/)
- [Search packages](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/)
- And more.
