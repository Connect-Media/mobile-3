          Ever wonder if something is <strong>packaged</strong> for Fedora

          <strong>Probably not.</strong> But maybe you will some day, and now

          Mobile's interface to the
          <a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages">Fedora Packages</a>
          API which provides a wealth of information about every Fedora package.

          Fedora Mobile lets you synchronize your

          synchronized and what information gets left alone.

          Instantly know when something happens that you care about. Fedora
          Mobile integrates with the <strong>Fedora Message Bus</strong>
          (fedmsg) to provide you instant notifications about topics that you
          subscribe to. We use the <strong>Google Cloud Messaging</strong>
          system, which saves battery life on your phone or tablet, since we
          don't need to hold a constant connection to the fedmsg stream.
